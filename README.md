# Sudoku---Multiple-Versions 
This holds all of the various sudoku games I've made over the years.<br>
1. **Summer 2018 - Python** Original Version<br>
- Fully working version, playable via command line inputs and printouts. 
- My first attempt at error catching, to this day, I haven't been able to break it.<br>
2. **August 2018 - Java** <br>
- Remade original game in Java with a focus on OOP principles and decreasing function algorithmic complexity  
- Turned some n^3 functions into n, and various other improvements
3. **October 2019 - C** <br>
- Hexadoku Boardgame with Autosolver and integrated backtracking on impossible guesses<br> 
- A class project from my Computer Architecture class.  I implemented my own version of a stack to keep 
track of board states, and then used a combination of deterministic and random choice number placements to 
attempt to solve the board state. <br>
4. **Feburary 2020 - Python** HackHERS Hackathon Build<br>
- Tried to use a Hackathon to teach myself how to build a Python GUI with TKinter, ended up following an indepth tutorial and learning a bit about how TKinter worked.
